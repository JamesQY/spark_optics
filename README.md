Spark_OPTICS

Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) is a hierarchical density-based data clustering algorithm, which can derive the intrinsic clustering structure of the dataset in a visual way, and can extract the basic clustering information by cluster sorting. However, due to its high temporal and spatial complexity, it can not adapt well to the large datasets in modern society. With the development of cloud computing and parallel computing, a method to solve the complexity of OPTICS algorithm is provided. In this paper, we propose a parallel OPTICS algorithm based on the Spark memory computing platform. The experimental results show that it can greatly reduce the time and space needs of the OPTICS algorithm.
